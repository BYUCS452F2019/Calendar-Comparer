Calendar Buddy
Compare your google calendar with others!

Project description:
Adding this google chrome extension will save your google calendar to our data base.  You then will be able to join and create groups in order to compare your calendar with others in your group.  A calendar will be generated for each group showing times when most people in the group are busy or free.

Team
I’m looking for around five others to join this team.

SQL
I am familiar with Microsoft SQL server but open to other options.

NO-SQL
I am familiar with AWS DynamoDB but open to other options.

Business
This app allows us to know when our clients and their friends are free, so companies will be able to advertise towards clients whose calendars are free during company events.  For example, if a company is wanting to advertise a concert coming up, we’ll be able to search the database for clients that are free for it.  We will also eventually implement a way for clients and groups to indicate the types of events they want suggested to them.

Legal
We will have those using the app indicate whether they’d like companies to know when they are free or not.  This will help avoid any issues with privacy.

Technical
Our priorities will be:

1.	Figure out how to create google chrome extensions
2.	Scrape event data off the google calendar
3.	Choose an initial SQL database to store data
4.	Generate comparison calendar with group members
